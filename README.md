# nodejs-aws-api

I wanted to build a quick and easy API in NodeJS using AWS dynamodb and EC2 for a few personal projects, and it was so quick to setup, I figured I would share it :)

## Installation

Clone the repo onto your local machine. Run <code>npm i</code>. Create a .env file with your AWS settings (accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, region, endpoint).

## Environmental files

Put these values in your .env file:

accessKeyId=[Your Access Key ID value from AWS] <br/>
secretAccessKey=[Your Secret Key value from AWS] <br/>
region=[Your AWS Region] <br/>
endpoint=[Your AWS EC2 endpoint]
