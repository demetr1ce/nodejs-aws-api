# nodejs-aws-api

I wanted to build a quick and easy API in NodeJS using AWS dynamodb for a few personal projects, and it was so quick to setup, I figured I would share it :)

## Installation

Clone the repo onto your local machine. Run <code>npm i</code>. After creating your dynamobd on AS, create a .env file with your AWS settings (accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, region, endpoint).

## Environmental files

<strong>Put these values in your .env file:</strong> <br/>
<code>accessKeyId=[Your Access Key ID value from AWS] <br/>
secretAccessKey=[Your Secret Key value from AWS] <br/>
region=[Your AWS Region] <br/>
endpoint=[Your AWS EC2 endpoint]</code>
